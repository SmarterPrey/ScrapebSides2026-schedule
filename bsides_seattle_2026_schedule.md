### 9:15 AM

#### Keynote: Social Engineering at Machine Speed

- **Speaker(s):** Eva Benn
- **Room:** Track 1
- **Duration:** 45 min

Principal Security Program Manager @ Microsoft | Cybersecurity Keynote Speaker, Thought Leader & Educator You hear a lot about how AI accelerates existing attacks and about the new surface created inside the systems that use it. But in the race to secure the machines, we may be missing something far more dangerous. AI brings the attack surface into everyday human life, and we have never seen that with any of the major technological shifts that reshaped the world. It reaches into our cognition and into the decisions that drive real outcomes. AI is not just speeding up threats. It is reshaping how the human mind processes trust, risk, and reality.

### 10:00 AM

#### Acts of God: How Cybercriminals Leverage AI to Exploit Breaking News

- **Speaker(s):** Andre Piazza
- **Room:** Track 3
- **Duration:** 55 min
- **Topic:** Lurking Dangers

Cybersecurity Strategist at BforeAI The “detect and respond” approach to cybersecurity is particularly vulnerable when cybercriminals exploit unexpected or "acts of God" events, ranging from natural disasters and geopolitical shifts to viral disinformation campaigns and economic turbulence, to launch sophisticated scams. These events create unique windows of opportunity for adversaries to manipulate public trust, urgent needs, or prevailing narratives through phishing, impersonation, and online fraud. The presentation will include cases taken from several threat advisory reports on scam and fraud activity catalyzed by real world events like the Los Angeles wildfires, the Texas floods, the Trump/Musk feud, and more. I will use real world examples to demonstrate how malicious actors use clever tactics and AI to quickly spin up scam campaigns that manipulate public sentiment. I will also discuss how internet-scale behavioral predictive analytics can identify and disrupt the types of malicious infrastructure used in these scams before they can be activated.

#### Demo Session: AI as the SOC Sidekick: Streamlining security without stepping over humans

- **Speaker(s):** Cliff Crosland
- **Room:** Track 5
- **Duration:** 25 min

CEO, Co-founder of Scanner.dev Can LLMs run your SOC on their own? Not yet. We tested it. We gave an AI agent tools to query alerts and logs, then asked it to triage hundreds of detection alerts autonomously. It did okay on false positives, but missed a real attack entirely, classifying coordinated privilege escalation and data exfiltration as routine activity. But other industries offer useful patterns for working with them: lawyers use AI in review iteration loops to produce artifacts together, and software engineers keep context in the codebase so agents can reference past work. This talk covers what those patterns look like applied to security investigations, with experiments and results showing how AI works well as a sidekick in the SOC, not a replacement.

### 10:30 AM

#### Breaking BOTS: Cheat Blue Team CTFs by building AI agents that investigate

- **Speaker(s):** lmeyerov
- **Room:** Track 1
- **Duration:** 25 min
- **Topic:** Uncharted Territory

Founder & CEO, Graphistry After we announced our results, CTFs like Splunk’s Boss of the SOC (BOTS) began banning AI agents. The reason is simple: We showed good agents finish most of it in under five minutes, not a full day. The recipe wasn’t exotic models or giant labs burning $10K in tokens. It was teaching agents to self-plan, adapt, catalog, and cope with big logs. Public LLMs are great when carefully engineered. We'll show how that works, including videos of the many ways agents break themselves, and how to reproduce everything at home with free and OSS tools. The real question isn't whether we can cat-and-mouse with CTF organizers, what does it mean to shift from being analysts-who-investigate to analysts-who-manage-AIs-that-investigate. This session gives objective measures on what that feels like today and outlines questions this raises for the next few years.

#### Don’t Run Six Checklists: A 25-Minute Sane Guide to AI + Healthcare GRC

- **Speaker(s):** Pranay Mehta
- **Room:** Track 4
- **Duration:** 25 min
- **Topic:** Real-World Chronicles

Senior Security & Compliance Analyst @ Headspace As LLMs show up in patient chat, note-assist, and care operations, tele-mental-health teams face overlapping expectations from HIPAA, NIST CSF 2.0, HHS 405(d), EO 14028, NIST AI RMF, and ISO/IEC 42001. Instead of running six parallel checklists, this session presents a single, plain-English map that aligns these frameworks into shared outcomes. We’ll outline a lightweight, HIPAA-aligned Security Risk Analysis (SRA) that security practitioners can run without deep ML expertise. We’ll also explain an easy likelihood×impact grid for clear decisions, and show three reusable artifacts that speed reviews and audits, without slowing delivery.

#### Waking Up to AI: An Adventure in Governance

- **Speaker(s):** Brian Myers
- **Room:** Track 1
- **Duration:** 55 min
- **Topic:** Uncharted Territory

Principal, SafetyLight LLC AI is advancing far faster than most organizations’ ability to govern it. This talk follows _MindPath_, a fictional small SaaS company that gradually discovers AI hiding in its tools, vendors, and workflows. With no policy and little awareness of AI risk, MindPath stumbles into an RFP question it can’t answer, uncovers shadow AI, and rushes to build enough governance to stay credible. This is a journey many companies are on now: ✅ Building an AI inventory ✅ Updating risk registers and contracts ✅ Dealing with vendor AI drift ✅ Initiating internal AI development The talk offers a candid, scenario-based look at how AI governance begins—not with polished frameworks, but with incomplete information, messy processes, and trade-offs rather than certainty. It’s designed to spark insight and shared learning about the practical realities of AI risk and oversight.

#### The Internet Is Fraying, But Maybe Security Can Hold It Together

- **Speaker(s):** Heather Flanagan
- **Room:** Track 3
- **Duration:** 25 min
- **Topic:** Lurking Dangers

Translator of Geek to Human The global Internet isn't as global as it once was. Export controls, regulatory divergence, and regional infrastructure policies are fragmenting connectivity. That fragmentation has direct consequences for security teams. Threat intelligence sharing, incident coordination, and standards-based trust all rely on an Internet that’s interoperable and transparent. As global networks splinter, defenders must learn to operate in a world where “global” threat response may no longer exist. This talk explores practical strategies for maintaining resilience: strengthening shared-signal channels, leaning on open standards, and designing for partial connectivity. Because if the Internet frays, security has to be the thread that holds it together.

#### Securing Non-Human Identities in CI/CD Pipelines: The Next Major Attack Vector

- **Speaker(s):** Dhivya Balasubramanian, Vikas Gattu
- **Room:** Track 4
- **Duration:** 55 min
- **Topic:** Real-World Chronicles

Dhivya Balasubramanian Southwest Airlines, Cybersecurity IAM Manager Vikas Gattu Southwest Airlines, TechLead Cybersecurity Engineer CI/CD pipelines have become the nervous system of modern development, but behind the automation lies an invisible army of non-human identities (NHIs): bots, service accounts, API tokens, and workload identities that deploy, test, and release your code. Unfortunately, they’ve also become attackers’ favorite new target. In this session, we’ll look at how modern breaches exploit these “ghost identities” hiding inside DevOps workflows, where least privilege, MFA, and traditional IAM don’t always reach. We’ll explore real-world attacks, the anatomy of NHI abuse, and how a single leaked token can pivot across repositories, environments, and cloud workloads. By the end, attendees will walk away with practical controls that combine identity governance, secrets management, and zero-trust for machines, equipping them to secure their pipelines before the next token breach makes headlines.

#### The DNS Puppet Master: Connecting WordPress Scams, Proxy Botnets, and StrelaStealer

- **Speaker(s):** David Brunsdon
- **Room:** Track 3
- **Duration:** 55 min
- **Topic:** Lurking Dangers

DNS Threat Researcher A DNS-based threat actor has been operating behind the scenes for years, controlling thousands of compromised websites like a puppet master. In 2025 they stepped up their operation by partnering with IBM X-Force designated threat actor Hive-0145 to deliver StrelaStealer malware using a novel technique that misleads analysts and obscures the true location of where the malware is hosted. This talk will illustrate how seemingly unrelated campaigns were connected via breadcrumbs found in DNS, revealing a persistent threat that had previously operated undetected.

#### Security Misconfigurations in the Cloud - "Oh Look, something fluffy, poke poke poke!"

- **Speaker(s):** Kat Fitzgerald
- **Room:** Track 4
- **Duration:** 55 min
- **Topic:** Real-World Chronicles

Just your average evilkat making life fun for her neighbor's appliances Cloud security shouldn’t feel like deciphering a spellbook written during a power outage. This talk starts by breaking down the core concepts of cloud architecture and access control using clear, memorable analogies—yes, “Pizza as a Service” makes an appearance. In just a few minutes, the audience will understand how IAM, org policies, and service boundaries compare to the on-prem world, and how attackers use these same models to find weak spots. Then it’s showtime. We dive into real-world cloud misconfigurations and the attack paths they create, with a mix of live demos (plus recorded backups, because the demo gods can be fickle) and open-source tools that anyone can use. We’ll walk through everything from “accidental” data exposure to the infamous public GitHub token that launched hundreds of crypto-mining VMs without detection. And yes—why cryptominers are often just the decoy for something far more concerning.

### 3:00 PM

#### United in Defense: Architecting Safe and Trustworthy AI Agents

- **Speaker(s):** Rabimba Karanjai
- **Room:** Track 1
- **Duration:** 25 min
- **Topic:** Uncharted Territory

Researcher | Google Developer Expert The leap from passive chatbots to autonomous AI agents represents a massive shift in the threat landscape. Agents don't just talk; they take action, executing code, accessing databases, and performing transactions. This introduces new vectors for "Unsafe Actions," such as data exfiltration, unauthorized resource access, and goal corruption where agents pursue proxy goals through reward hacking. To secure this new frontier, we cannot rely on a single control. We need a united architecture that binds identity, network isolation, and model guardrails together. This session explores the "defense in depth" strategy required to build trustworthy agents, utilizing frameworks like the Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Agent Engine to harmonize security across the entire agent lifecycle.

- **Speaker(s):** Ksenia Iliuk
- **Room:** Track 3
- **Duration:** 25 min
- **Topic:** Lurking Dangers

Co-founder @ LetsData | Information operations specialist with a decade of experience supporting institutions and national security partners Information operations are no longer just hostile states trying to interfere in the elections – they increasingly sit in the reconnaissance and preparation phase of cyberattacks. This session explores how threat actors use AI to spin up synthetic identities, seed coordinated messaging, mimic trusted brands, and quietly steer users toward malware and fraud at scale. Attendees will gain a practical understanding of what “pre-attack information activity” looks like in the wild, how to differentiate organic chatter from coordinated behavior, and how CTI teams can incorporate these signals into existing monitoring and response workflows.

#### Layering defenses: A new hope?

- **Speaker(s):** Adam Shostack
- **Room:** Track 4
- **Duration:** 55 min
- **Topic:** Real-World Chronicles

Adam is a leading expert on threat modeling, and a teacher, entrepreneur, author and game designer. In threat modeling, we consider "what are we going to do" and people's background dramatically narrows how they answer that question. This talk presents a new framework of defenses: isolation, defensive coding, features and products. These defenses can be layered, but many people will gravitate to one or another, rather than think strategically about layering. Common understanding of defenses can help us unite to secure systems.

### 3:30 PM

#### Evading Detection with Dynamic AI Mimicry

- **Speaker(s):** Darin Smith, Moazzam Khan
- **Room:** Track 1
- **Duration:** 25 min
- **Topic:** Uncharted Territory

Darin Smith Leader, Security Research, Cisco Talos Moazzam Khan Software Engineer Threat actors are increasingly leveraging large language models (LLMs) to create adaptive malware that evades traditional detection methods. This research introduces a novel AI-assisted malware prototype that enhances stealth by intelligently adapting to target environments. Our cloud provider discovery framework enumerates systems for evidence of AWS, Azure, or GCP usage, enabling malware to select the most appropriate cloud service for command and control operations. We demonstrate this capability through a novel agentic framework for macOS that dynamically leverages enterprise cloud AI services (AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, or GCP Vertex AI) to blend malicious traffic with legitimate enterprise activity. This approach significantly complicates detection by mimicking authorized cloud usage patterns. We provide actionable defensive recommendations including comprehensive AI service monitoring, strict access controls, and prohibition of unauthorized AI platforms, while outlining future research into embedded models and novel detection methodologies.

#### Demo Session: The Agentic Helpdesk: From Tickets to Automated Resolution

- **Speaker(s):** Kevin Coleman
- **Room:** Track 5
- **Duration:** 25 min

Co-Founder, Ravenna For decades, help desks have been built around tickets, queues, and portal; systems designed to receive work, not resolve it. As organizations adopt AI across the enterprise, that model is breaking down. Whether you’re building internal tools, modernizing IT and operations, or designing AI-native products, this session will show why the future of the help desk isn’t about tickets, it’s about resolving employee issues faster and delivering exceptional internal services.

### 4:00 PM

#### Red Teaming AI Systems for Security Validation

- **Speaker(s):** Ankush Gupta
- **Room:** Track 1
- **Duration:** 55 min
- **Topic:** Uncharted Territory

ANKUSH GUPTA ENTERPRISE ARCHITECT T-Mobile USA Inc There is a growing trend in which artificial intelligence (AI) is embedded in safety-critical where Cyber Security is a mandate, regulatory-driven, or high impact domains such as healthcare, finance, public infrastructure, enterprise automation. The larger these systems become, however, the more apparent the risks such systems pose from adversarial exploitation, model manipulability, and the unsafe integration of tools. AI models are different from traditional software in that they exhibit probabilistic and context-dependency nature and hence exhibit unique vulnerabilities including prompt injection, jailbreaks, data poisoning, model extraction, and unsafe autonomous decision-making. Red teaming is becoming an important technique to evaluate AI systems under real world adversarial settings. It’s the systematic stress-testing of models to identify holes before bad actors can exploit them. Nevertheless, contemporary red team approaches are fragmented with little shared taxonomies, common benchmarks or integration with governance. To fill in these gaps, this paper presents COMPASS-RT, Cyber Security essentials, a model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic framework for AI red teaming.

- **Speaker(s):** Santosh Kandala
- **Room:** Track 2
- **Duration:** 25 min
- **Topic:** Bridging Divides

Security Engineering Lead @ OpenAI Building and scaling security teams in high-velocity environments is often more art than science. Drawing from his experience of building six security organizations from scratch across startups and hyper-growth companies, the speaker shares candid lessons, missteps, and the battle scars no one talks about. Instead of another “best practices” talk, expect a refreshing focus on what not to do—the traps, temptations, and structural mistakes that stunt security teams before they can shine. Leaders will walk away with pragmatic guidance on hiring, creating leverage, investing beyond the security org, and scaling culture with intentionality.

#### Android Security and Countersurveillance With GrapheneOS

- **Speaker(s):** Andrew Lebedinsky
- **Room:** Track 3
- **Duration:** 55 min
- **Topic:** Lurking Dangers

Security Engineer As we become ever more reliant on our phones for most aspects of our day-to-day lives, the need for our phones' operating systems to provide guarantees of privacy and security increases. This talk will examine the ways in which law enforcement agencies, companies like Cellebrite, data brokers, and other threat actors leverage privacy flaws in "stock" Android versions. Many of these flaws are mitigated by GrapheneOS, a privacy-focused Android fork. We will discuss the technical details of these mitigations, as well as how at-risk individuals like journalists and activists can use GrapheneOS effectively to defend themselves in an increasingly surveillance-heavy digital landscape.

#### Cloud’s Dirty Little Secret: It Was Misconfigs All Along

- **Speaker(s):** Karl Ots
- **Room:** Track 4
- **Duration:** 55 min
- **Topic:** Real-World Chronicles

Head of Cloud Security at EPAM | Author and Inventor Everyone loves to chase the next big exploit, but here’s the truth: most cloud breaches don’t start with some elite APT magic — they start with someone leaving the front door wide open. Misconfigurations are the silent killer of cloud security, and they’re everywhere. After tearing down hundreds of Azure deployments across industries, I’ve seen the same screw-ups again and again — from Fortune 500s to scrappy startups. In this talk, I’ll walk through the most common cloud security faceplants, why they’re so easy to make (and miss), and how to actually fix them before someone else finds them first. If you’ve ever wondered what cloud security looks like when it fails quietly, this is your wake-up call.

#### The Security Policy Rollout Survival Guide

- **Speaker(s):** Maya Kaczorowski
- **Room:** Track 2
- **Duration:** 25 min
- **Topic:** Bridging Divides

CEO / Founder, Oblique Security policies rarely fail because of technical problems, but rather due to organizational challenges. Implementing a new security control is difficult: meeting compliance requirements, getting buy-in from stakeholders, and providing support as part of a coordinated, smooth rollout. In this talk, we'll present a practical playbook for rolling out security controls effectively, covering both production (peer review, code scanning) and corporate security controls (MFA, MDM, vendor reviews). We'll cover how to build buy-in before you announce anything, why your pilot program determines success or failure, how to gather and actually use feedback, and how to manage exceptions without undermining the policy. You'll come away understanding why user satisfaction matters more than percent compliance: because security only works when everyone is actually on board.

- **Speaker(s):** Sarah Cecchetti
- **Room:** Track 1
- **Duration:** 25 min
- **Topic:** Uncharted Territory

Director of Product Strategy, Beyond Identity It's 2026. You can no longer rely on video or voice to identify people. OAuth is being bent into strange shapes to try to make it adapt to agentic workflows. FIDO can no longer require human interaction or consent because the workers it is protecting are not human. In short, your local identity and access management professional needs a hug. This session will cover how we're coping with these brave new technical challenges using our tried and true weapons of standards, teamwork, and duct tape.

#### From Chaos to Control: A Modern Approach to UAF Attack Detection

- **Speaker(s):** Nader Ammari
- **Room:** Track 3
- **Duration:** 55 min
- **Topic:** Lurking Dangers

Microsoft (member of the Regulated Industries security team) Use After Free (UAF) flaws remain among the most dangerous, valuable and pervasive memory safety bugs—especially in large, multi process, multi threaded applications like modern browsers. Big players spend heavily on planet scale fuzzers (e.g., Google's ClusterFuzz or MSFT's OneFuzz) and global bug bounties where even a simple browser crash—without a working PoC—can net $5k–$150k, a quick inspection of Chromium’s public bug bounty program alone shows that tens of millions of dollars are spent annually on relatively simple crash reports related to potential UAFs, some of which could represent zero‑days exploited in the wild.. Meanwhile, AddressSanitizer (ASan) provides excellent visibility but comes with high overhead, requires recompilation, and is often impractical or impossible for unmanaged/closed source components. Worse, most tools only detect a UAF after it happens which is bit weird since we need to trigger the UAF to detect its existence and hence the need for fuzzing. This talk presents a three year independent research project that flips the problem: detect UAF conditions before the exploit occurs. Using dynamic binary instrumentation (no recompilation), we track deallocators, identify memory that has been freed, scan thread stacks for references to those freed regions, unwind the stacks to attribute function parameters and locals, and do this continuously across processes and threads during execution. We then use AI + RAG to search for feasible call paths that can transition a UAF condition into a triggerable UAF.

#### No time to Spy: Uncovering Domains Distributing SpyNote Malware

- **Speaker(s):** Daniel “DFS” Schwalbe
- **Room:** Track 3
- **Duration:** 55 min
- **Topic:** Lurking Dangers

Head of Investigations at DomainTools Coming soon to a BSides near you, get an undercover look at a network of threat groups using newly registered domains disguised as Google Chrome installation pages to deliver SpyNote malware. This RAT is a notorious tool for Bond villains like OilRig (APT34), APT-C-37 (Pat-Bear), and OilAlpha because of its potential for control, monitoring, and exfiltration of data out of compromised devices. Once deployed, SpyNote likely can’t be removed without a factory reset. Newly registered domains provide the perfect cover for threat actors to build infrastructure perfect for deploying this malware. The majority of domains used for malware are less than 48 hours old. Dr. No, Dr. Evil, and any aspiring Mini Mes can use new domains, or reuse domains that were once live on the Internet and then abandoned for malware distribution or botnets in the first minutes of going live. Domain registration, website structure, and language comments within the delivery site code are united with the malware and can be leveraged to identify these pages and connect them to the infrastructure of those behind these plots. Uncovering patterns in the registrars, IP ISPs, SSL issuers, server types, resolvers, endpoint paths, and HTML code inclusions unite the pages observed to secure against threats previously unseen. Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to join this briefing on SpyNote’s capabilities, the vulnerabilities within the patterns of its deployment, and tactics that can help surface newly discovered, active, and observed domains and hostnames to defend against malware.

- **Speaker(s):** Dimple Gajra, Hem Parekh
- **Room:** Track 4
- **Duration:** 25 min
- **Topic:** Real-World Chronicles

Dimple Gajra Privacy engineer Hem Parekh Privacy in Security When we run security reviews, we’re great at spotting vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and access issues — but privacy often falls through the cracks. We talk about encryption and authentication, yet rarely ask: Do we even need to collect this data? or What happens when it’s deleted? Privacy isn’t just a compliance checkbox; it’s a trust issue. In this talk, we’ll explore why privacy deserves a bigger role in security reviews and how integrating privacy considerations can strengthen both product design and user confidence. We’ll talk about real-world lessons from reviewing large-scale applications, how privacy and security overlap, and what steps teams can take to embed privacy-by-design into every review cycle — without turning it into more bureaucracy.

#### Defending the Supply Chain: Building a Real-Time Package Firewall

- **Speaker(s):** Dale Bustad
- **Room:** Track 4
- **Duration:** 25 min
- **Topic:** Real-World Chronicles

Staff Software Engineer at Socket Modern software development relies heavily on open source dependencies from package registries like npm, PyPI, and Maven. With billions of weekly downloads, these registries have become prime targets for supply chain attacks — from the recent npm compromise (publicly known as “Shai-Hulud”) affecting 2.6 billion weekly downloads to sophisticated typosquatting campaigns. Traditional security tools like dependency scanners and SBOMs operate post-installation, leaving a critical gap in real-time protection. This talk presents the technical architecture and implementation strategies behind a package firewall, an HTTP(S) proxy that intercepts package manager requests and enforces security policies in real-time before malicious packages reach developer machines or production environments. We'll explore the challenges of building a multi-ecosystem security proxy, including TLS interception, PURL parsing across package managers, and handling the performance demands of high-throughput development workflows. Attendees will learn practical techniques for implementing network-level security controls and the real-world challenges of maintaining compatibility across diverse package manager ecosystems.

#### The Phantom of the Infrastructure: Investigating the Hidden IAM Risks in Bedrock API Keys

- **Speaker(s):** Sergio Garcia
- **Room:** Track 1
- **Duration:** 25 min
- **Topic:** Uncharted Territory

Security Researcher, BeyondTrust In the rush to adopt Generative AI, cloud providers are prioritizing speed over transparency. Amazon Bedrock’s new API keys promise instant access, but they introduce a critical identity blind spot: a "long-term" key silently provisions a dedicated IAM user with a policy named AmazonBedrockLimitedAccess. But don’t let the policy name fool you. My research reveals that this "limited" default configuration grants surprising destructive capabilities across the entire AI environment, including the power to wipe out security controls and custom models. This architecture effectively turns a simple "inference" key into a pre-configured tool for infrastructure sabotage. Join me for a live demonstration where I bypass SDKs entirely using a single raw curl command. I will exploit this identity model to sabotage AI Guardrails in real-time and share the vendor-neutral detection logic needed to secure these "phantom" keys before they are weaponized.

- **Speaker(s):** Dillon Rangel
- **Room:** Track 1
- **Duration:** 25 min
- **Topic:** Uncharted Territory

Hacker This talk demonstrates a method for extracting arbitrary data from air-gapped networks using electromagnetic radiation leaking from LCD monitor cables. I developed an encoding scheme that transmits ASCII characters through controlled screen brightness patterns. The resulting AM radio signals are detectable from 20+ feet away through multiple walls. I'll walk through the technical process of encoding data for maximum signal amplitude, capturing clean waveforms, and automatically decoding transmissions using Python. The research addresses modern LCD monitors specifically, as most prior TEMPEST work focused on obsolete CRT displays. This proof of concept shows that with one time physical access (or clever social engineering), an attacker can continuously exfiltrate data from supposedly secure environments using nothing more than a laptop and antenna.

#### When Home Isn't Safe: Detecting Malicious Networks Hidden Behind Residential Proxies

- **Speaker(s):** Duong Dinh
- **Room:** Track 3
- **Duration:** 25 min
- **Topic:** Lurking Dangers

Security & Cloud Researcher, Master's Student @ Purdue University Recent studies suggest that a large fraction, often 30–90%, of traffic through major residential-proxy services is linked to fraudulent behavior. Residential proxy networks are increasingly weaponized to disguise malicious activity as harmless home-user traffic. Residential proxy networks have evolved from hobbyist home-sharing tools and botnet exits into a mature market used by fraudsters to hide credential stuffing, web scraping, click fraud, and stealth command/communication channels. In this talk we trace that evolution: where residential proxies came from (botnets, ISP reseller), how free VPN and proxy services monetize user bandwidth and data, and why attackers favor residential exits over datacenter IPs. We’ll break down how these networks operate, demonstrate practical detection techniques, like TTL pattern analysis, reverse DNS fingerprinting, and behavioral timing, and showcase short demos. Attendees will also walk through historical attack patterns and a compact case study that exposes a malicious campaign routed through innocent home IPs.

#### Abusing Windows Transactions as Covert Channels for IPC

- **Speaker(s):** Noah Bradley
- **Room:** Track 1
- **Duration:** 55 min
- **Topic:** Uncharted Territory

Offensive Security Consultant, Windows Red Team Operator Attackers commonly use traditional IPC channels such as named and anonymous pipes, sockets, and RPC to coordinate and move data between processes. Defenders have built mature detections into EDR and XDR products to monitor and alert on these behaviors. As attackers, we need a stealthier way to bypass common detections without relying solely on encryption and obfuscation. This talk introduces Windows transactions as a quieter alternative, showing how transactional contexts can be abused as a covert IPC channel, how this differs from traditional mechanisms, and what practical limitations and detection angles exist in real environments. Red teams get a concrete approach to turning transactions into a working covert channel. Blue teams get practical telemetry sources and detection strategies they can apply directly in their own environments.

In this session, we will take you behind the scenes of real audit engagements to show how access, change, and operational controls are tested and why they matter far beyond passing an audit. Drawing from our combined experience in cybersecurity, governance, and risk, we will share lessons learned, common pitfalls, and practical ways to design audit-ready environments that strengthen overall security posture. Attendees will gain actionable insights to prevent recurring findings, improve evidence collection, and bridge the gap between security and compliance teams. Whether you are a security engineer or a GRC professional, this talk will help you transform the way you approach audits from a yearly requirement to a continuous improvement opportunity.

#### You, me, and the HSM: E2EE’s move to hardware

- **Speaker(s):** Eric Chiang
- **Room:** Track 4
- **Duration:** 25 min
- **Topic:** Real-World Chronicles

CTO - Oblique Encrypted messaging is hard. Users lose devices and choose weak passwords, but still want access to old conversations. As more encrypted client data is being stored server-side, E2EE implementations have started leveraging secure hardware for key derivation, turning short PINs into strong cryptographic keys. But can you really not trust the server if you have to trust an HSM? This talk will explore three prominent deployments of hardware based solutions for encrypted messengers: Signal’s Secure Value Recovery, WhatsApp’s Backup Key Vault, and the Juicebox Protocol used by X.

#### Demo Session: The Agentic Helpdesk: From Tickets to Automated Resolution

- **Speaker(s):** Kevin Coleman
- **Room:** Track 5
- **Duration:** 25 min

Co-Founder, Ravenna For decades, help desks have been built around tickets, queues, and portal; systems designed to receive work, not resolve it. As organizations adopt AI across the enterprise, that model is breaking down. Whether you’re building internal tools, modernizing IT and operations, or designing AI-native products, this session will show why the future of the help desk isn’t about tickets, it’s about resolving employee issues faster and delivering exceptional internal services.

#### Zero Trust in the Matrix: Hardening Kubernetes for the AI Frontier

- **Speaker(s):** Apoorv Dayal
- **Room:** Track 1
- **Duration:** 25 min
- **Topic:** Uncharted Territory

Security Software Engineer @ Microsoft The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern has forced security teams to rethink the defense perimeter. In Kubernetes, simply securing the cluster boundary is insufficient; we must secure the AI data flow itself. This 25-minute, practitioner-focused talk focuses on strategies one can adopt across the entire ML supply chain. We will move beyond generic container security to focus on critical AI-specific threats.

#### Security Awareness Training is Your Best Stealth Marketing Campaign

- **Speaker(s):** Ralph Hogaboom, Liz Lewis-Lee
- **Room:** Track 2
- **Duration:** 25 min
- **Topic:** Bridging Divides

Ralph Hogaboom CISO, WA Dept of Natural Resources Liz Lewis-Lee CIO for WA Department of Natural Resources Most security awareness programs are time-consuming, compliance-driven, and deliver very little in the way of real security outcomes. Annual trainings get ignored, phishing simulations irritate people, and the security team ends up seen as the department of “no” rather than a partner. Yet inside every organization, security desperately needs trust, visibility, and influence to make any meaningful change. This talk flips the script: instead of treating awareness as mandatory training, treat it as internal marketing. When awareness becomes a deliberate strategy for relationship-building, narrative-setting, and communicating value, it becomes one of the most powerful tools a security team has. You’ll learn how to turn your awareness program into a lightweight, repeatable engine that builds allies, improves visibility, and helps security initiatives land more smoothly across the organization.

#### Ghosts in the Hypervisor: Dissecting TTPs Behind Ransomware Attacks on Virtualization Infrastructure

- **Speaker(s):** Austin Gadient
- **Room:** Track 3
- **Duration:** 55 min
- **Topic:** Lurking Dangers

Vali Cyber CTO & Co-Founder While cloud security and AI threats dominate headlines, a quieter crisis is unfolding in core enterprise infrastructure. Virtualization platforms are being targeted with a level of destructiveness not seen before, despite the fact the technology has been around for decades. One of the most disruptive forces in this space is the threat actor commonly referred to as Scattered Spider, credited with major intrusions into VMware environments at organizations such as MGM Casinos (2023), Marks & Spencer (2025), and the Co-op (2025). Public reporting estimates the combined business impact of these breaches to exceed $1B. This session provides a technical deep dive into how these attacks unfold in the real world. It begins by examining the group’s initial access techniques, especially voice phishing used to compromise enterprise identity systems. From there, the talk follows the attacker’s path as they escalate privileges, compromise vCenter, and prepare environments for large-scale ESXi encryption.

#### C Libraries: Shining a Light on a Security Blind Spot

- **Speaker(s):** Max vonBlankenburg
- **Room:** Track 4
- **Duration:** 55 min
- **Topic:** Real-World Chronicles

Security Researcher at Semgrep If I’m a Node developer, and I want to get rid of vulnerable dependencies, I run “npm audit”. If I’m a GitHub user, I run dependabot. So, what do I do if I’m a C++ developer? For decades there hasn’t been an easy way to identify vulnerable C packages in our projects, and the problem has only gotten slightly better. In this talk, I will describe why it’s so difficult to find and fix third-party vulnerabilities in C & C++ projects, and lay out possible solutions for making this developer ecosystem more responsive and resilient to the next libwebp, xz and heartbleed incidents.
